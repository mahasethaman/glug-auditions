## DISCKO 2

**Category:** Forensics / Disk Analysis  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

### Problem Summary
This challenge provided a disk image similar to DISCKO 1 but required a deeper level of analysis. The objective was to examine the disk image carefully and uncover hidden or less obvious data stored inside it.

### Approach
Based on my experience from DISCKO 1, I first confirmed the file type and treated it as a disk image rather than a regular file. Since this was a medium-level challenge, I expected the data to be more deeply hidden.

I explored the disk image structure and looked for file system clues and embedded information. Instead of relying on a single command, I combined multiple inspection techniques to narrow down where the relevant data was stored.

Through systematic analysis and exploration, I was able to extract the required information from the disk image.

### Tools Used
- `file`
- `strings`
- disk image analysis tools
- Linux command line utilities

### Key Learning
This challenge helped me understand that medium-level forensic problems often require patience and a structured approach, as data may be hidden in non-obvious locations within disk images.
