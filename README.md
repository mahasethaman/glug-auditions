# GLUG picoCTF Audition Submission

This repository contains my picoCTF challenge solutions submitted by me in the GLUG Club auditions.

I worked on multiple easy and medium level challenges across different categories. The main goal while solving these challenges was not just to get the flag, but to understand how things work under the hood and improve my problem-solving and Linux skills.
