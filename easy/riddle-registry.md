### Problem Summary
The challenge presented a set of riddles that needed to be solved to uncover hidden information leading to the flag. Each riddle acted as a clue that pushed the solution forward.

### Approach
I began by carefully reading each riddle to understand what it was hinting at. Instead of guessing randomly, I treied to first analyze the file and then tried to get the strings, after getting some enocoded things in the metadata,
I started decoding the base64 and after decoding the base64 I got the flags.

### Tools Used
- Basic decoding techniques
- Linux command line (when required)

### Key Learning
This challenge helped me improve my ability to break down problems into smaller parts and reinforced the importance of patience and structured thinking while solving CTF challenges.
