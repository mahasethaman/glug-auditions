## Flag in Flame

**Category:** File Analysis / General skills  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

### Problem Summary
The challenge provided a file related to a flame or fire-themed context. The objective was to carefully inspect the file and identify any hidden or unusual information that could lead to the flag.

### Approach
I began by examining the file type and its contents instead of relying on the filename or appearance alone. Since easy challenges often hide information in a straightforward manner, I focused on basic inspection techniques.

By exploring the file using simple command-line tools, I was able to identify readable or embedded data that did not belong to normal file content. This led me to the hidden information required to solve the challenge.

### Tools Used
- `file`
- `strings`
- Linux command line utilities

### Key Learning
This challenge reinforced the idea that even simple-looking files can contain hidden information and that basic analysis tools are often enough to uncover it.
